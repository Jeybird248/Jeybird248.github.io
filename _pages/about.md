Oh, hey there! I’m Jehyeok Yeon, a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Linguistics. I'm preparing for graduate studies, with a focus on building intelligent systems that are both technically robust and socially responsible.

My research focuses on trustworthy and agentic AI. I'm interested in how we can design systems that make autonomous decisions while remaining predictable, safe, and aligned with human intent. In particular, I explore how we can formalize and evaluate agency in AI systems, especially in multi-agent contexts. My current projects include a quantitative certification framework for agentic AI tool usage, a model of leadership in multi-agent systems to better understand coordination and influence in decentralized environments. More broadly, I’m interested in the theoretical foundations of AI behavior and how these can be strengthened and/or exploited.

Outside of research, I care a lot about writing, both creative and academic, and how it shapes the way we think. I spend a lot of time walking and thinking through ideas, and I try to catch theatre performances whenever I can. There's something powerful about live storytelling that reminds me why I study intelligence in the first place. I also dabble in designing cover art and animated videos for music videos and singing anonymous covers that will never see the light of day.
