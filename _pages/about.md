Greetings! I'm Jehyeok Yeon, a dedicated student pursuing my studies in Computer Science and Linguistics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am passionate about exploring the synergy between technology and language, delving into the fascinating realm where computer languages meet human ones.

At Illinois, I'm currently working on a web app with UIUC's Applied Technologies for Learning in the Arts & Sciences for developing the English skills for ESL students using the power of AI. I've also recently presented my work about the intersection between political ideology and entrepreneurship at the Undergraduate Research Symposium. I'll be working as an AI Data Scientist at Hanwha Life for the summer, developing a insurance-based chatbot for insurance customers.

On a given day, you'll find me making something, whether it be working on side projects at the Main Library or making myself a nice meal in the kitchen. You'll find some of my creations (of both types) across this website, along with other bits and pieces from my life in the `blog` section.
