Oh, hey there! I’m Jehyeok Yeon—a Computer Science and Linguistics student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which is just a fancy way of saying I spend my days thinking about how humans and machines can talk to each other without things getting awkward. It’s as nerdy as it sounds, and I love every second of it.

These days, I’m particularly interested in the idea of agentic AI—systems that don't just react but act with intention (or at least something that looks like it). Think less "robot butler" and more "collaborative problem-solver that doesn’t need constant babysitting." I’m diving into questions like: If we’re building AI in humanity’s image, are we also inheriting all the baggage that comes with it—biases, stereotypes, and centuries of flawed thinking baked into the texts these models learn from? Because let’s be honest, humanity might not be the best role model for a system we expect to be, well, better than us. And while mimicking human behavior has worked wonders for improving AI performance so far, how far can we really take that? What about the more abstract, messy stuff—like leadership, societal constructs, and the patterns we’ve developed over millennia? How closely does AI actually follow our lead, and should it?

When I’m not pondering the future of AI or wrangling code, you can usually find me creating—whether that’s tinkering with my latest side project, Deetox (an educational detoxing app built to NOT be addictive), or developing accessibility features for low-vision users and implementing full-stack solutions to transform lecture videos into accessible content on ClassTranscribe. On the more artistic side of things, I dabble in designing cover art and animated videos for music videos and singing anonymous covers for songs I like listening to. Oh, and there’s an original song in the works—because apparently, I don’t believe in staying in just one lane.

Curious about what I’ve been up to? Head over to my `CV` page for the full scoop on my past projects, internships, and research adventures. Spoiler alert: there’s a lot of AI, a dash of entrepreneurship, and maybe a pinch of chaos. Or take a peek into my `blog` page to see some articles that I may regret oversharing on later down the line. Good stuff.
