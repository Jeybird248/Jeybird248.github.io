Greetings! I'm Jehyeok Yeon, a dedicated student pursuing my studies in Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am passionate about exploring the synergy between technology and language, delving into the fascinating realm where computer languages meet human ones.

At Illinois, I've been actively involved in various projects and experiences that align with my interests. I'm currently working on ClassTranscribe, developing accessibility features for low-vision users and implementing full-stack solutions to transform lecture videos into accessible content. I've also recently presented my work about the intersection between political ideology and entrepreneurship at the Undergraduate Research Symposium.

Last summer, I had the chance to work as an AI Data Scientist at Hanwha Life Insurance, where I be developed a fullstack application specializing in the insurance domain utilizing advanced RAG strategies with Large Language Models and a hybrid retriever utilizing ElasticSearch.

On a given day, you'll find me making something, whether it be working on side projects or making myself a nice meal in the kitchen. Some of my recent projects include an ESL Learning Hub Web App, which enhances reading comprehension and grammar proficiency for ESL students, and a Note Generation Chrome Extension that automates note generation from various media sources.

You'll find some of my creations (of both types) across this website, along with other bits and pieces from my life in the `blog` section.
