At my last internship, I developed a  RAG-based chatbot with a full-stack web platform that used state-of-the-art techniques from the latest research. In a research project with a post-doctorate student in Agriculture, I employed scikit-learn and TensorFlow to model wheat growth factors and will be continuing the project further this semester to predict total soil phosphorus levels. As the Machine Learning Team Lead and President at Codable, I led projects across multiple domains, including a chopstick position corrector using OpenCV and TensorFlow for Computer Vision, an MBTI analyzer based on texting patterns utilizing NLTK and spaCy with transformer models for NLP, and a stock prediction tool with LSTM networks using Keras for Time Series Analysis. These projects involved data preprocessing with pandas, visualization with matplotlib and seaborn, and version control with Git. I'm currently working on the deployment of ML models through frameworks such as Django.
