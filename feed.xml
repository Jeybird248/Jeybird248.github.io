The authors introduce a novel framework for integrating LLMs into the CybORG CAGE 4 simulation environment, enabling mixed teams of LLM and RL agents to defend networks against adversarial threats. The study also proposes a new communication protocol for agent collaboration and evaluates both agent types across various adversarial scenarios. Key findings highlight LLMs’ strengths in explainability and adaptability, while also identifying their limitations in speed, reward optimization, and susceptibility to prompt engineering and hallucination.</p> <center> <img src="../../../assets/img/literature/11_0.png" width="600"/> <figcaption>Figure 1: Overview of our LLM Adapter Framework</figcaption> </center> <hr/> <h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2> <p><strong>1. LLMs as Autonomous Cyber Defenders</strong></p> <ul> <li>LLMs can serve as ACD agents, providing explainable, human-interpretable decisions in simulated cyber defense scenarios.</li> <li>Unlike RL agents, LLMs do not require environment-specific training and can generalize knowledge from diverse threat models and networks, leveraging their pre-training.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Multi-Agent Integration and Communication</strong></p> <ul> <li>The paper presents the first integration of LLMs and RL agents in a multi-agent cyber defense setting using CybORG CAGE 4.</li> <li>A novel 8-bit communication protocol allows agents to share threat intelligence, network security levels, and their operational status efficiently, enhancing team coordination.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Natural Language Observation and Action Formatting</strong></p> <ul> <li>Observations from the simulation are translated into natural language prompts for LLMs, enabling them to process and reason about network states similarly to human experts.</li> <li>LLM responses are parsed for structured actions and justifications, with fallback mechanisms for invalid outputs.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Prompt Engineering and Model Selection</strong></p> <ul> <li>The study demonstrates that prompt design significantly affects LLM performance. Role-based and few-shot prompting yields better results than instructional prompting alone.</li> <li>Lightweight models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) offer a tradeoff between inference speed and reward, but still lag behind RL agents in raw performance.</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. Experimental Evaluation</strong></p> <ul> <li>RL agents (KEEP GNN PPO) consistently outperform LLMs in terms of the CAGE 4 reward function, especially under diverse adversarial strategies.</li> <li>LLM agents excel in explainability and adaptability, often providing nuanced reasoning for their actions and showing flexibility in unfamiliar scenarios.</li> <li>LLMs are notably slower (up to 150x) than RL agents due to inference overhead, making real-time deployment challenging.</li> </ul> <p><strong>6. Action Selection and Reasoning Analysis</strong></p> <ul> <li>Clustering and embedding analysis of LLM-generated justifications reveal coherent, security-driven strategies (e.g., proactive decoy deployment, targeted analysis, and response to peer alerts).</li> <li>LLMs favor deception and analysis actions, while RL agents tend toward passive monitoring and conservative interventions to minimize penalties.</li> <li>LLMs occasionally hallucinate or misinterpret communication vectors, highlighting the need for more robust prompt engineering and action definition.</li> </ul> <p><strong>7. Limitations and Future Directions</strong></p> <ul> <li>The CAGE 4 environment is tailored for RL, potentially biasing reward functions against LLMs.</li> <li>LLMs’ lack of explicit training on the reward structure and their reliance on prompt clarity can hinder optimal performance.</li> <li>Future work should explore hybrid strategies, improved prompt engineering, and model fine-tuning for cyber defense contexts.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br/> A blue (defender) agent receives an observation indicating suspicious activity on a host and a peer agent’s alert of potential compromise.</p> <p><strong>LLM Agent Response:</strong><br/> {“action”: “Analyse host-3”, “reason”: “Suspicious connections detected and peer agent reported possible compromise; further analysis is required before taking disruptive action.”}</p> <p><strong>RL Agent Response:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Monitors or sleeps, only escalating to analysis if repeated suspicious activity is detected, to avoid unnecessary penalties.</li> </ul> <hr/> <center> <img src="../../../assets/img/literature/11_1.png" width="500"/> <figcaption>Figure 2: CAGE 4 Challenge Architecture</figcaption> </center> <hr/> <h2 id="ratings">Ratings</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Category</th> <th>Score</th> <th>Justification</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Novelty</td> <td>4.5</td> <td>First to systematically evaluate LLMs as ACD agents in a multi-agent, mixed-team setting with a new communication protocol.

The authors identify that LLMs sometimes over-focus on local information from demonstrations, leading to errors by “taking things out of context.” They propose <strong>Few-shot Attention Intervention (FAI)</strong>, a lightweight method that dynamically analyzes and adjusts attention patterns to suppress the distracting effect of such tokens. Extensive experiments across math, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks show that FAI consistently improves accuracy, notably achieving a 5.91% gain on the AQuA dataset.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="../../../assets/img/literature/12_0.png" width="600"/> </p> <p align="center"><em>Figure: Overview of the FAI method. FAI identifies and intervenes on distracting tokens in each layer's attention matrix, improving reasoning robustness without significant computational overhead.</em></p> <h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2> <ul> <li> <p><strong>CoT Fragility and Token Distraction:</strong><br/> While CoT prompting improves LLM reasoning, the paper demonstrates that even single tokens or phrases in demonstrations can mislead the model. This distraction manifests as the model copying irrelevant details or being implicitly biased by local demonstration artifacts, resulting in incorrect answers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mechanism Analysis via Attention Saliency:</strong><br/> The authors use attention saliency techniques to trace information flow within LLMs at each output step. They find that tokens with high self-attention and low aggregation from other tokens are most likely to distract the model, as their semantic content is preserved and directly influences output generation.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Few-shot Attention Intervention (FAI):</strong><br/> FAI identifies tokens with insufficient information aggregation (i.e., high self-attention) in the demonstration and blocks their attention flow to output tokens during generation. This intervention is efficient, requiring only lightweight computation and affecting about 15% of demonstration tokens on average.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Empirical Validation:</strong><br/> FAI delivers consistent accuracy improvements across multiple LLMs (GPT2-XL, GPT-NEO, Llama-3-8B/70B) and datasets (GSM8K, AQuA, CSQA, Big-Bench-Hard, Last Letter Concatenation). The most significant boost is observed on math reasoning tasks, where distracting tokens are prevalent.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ablation and Robustness Studies:</strong><br/> The paper constructs “GSMgood” and “GSMbad” subsets to isolate the effect of distraction. FAI notably improves performance on GSMbad (samples vulnerable to distraction) without harming GSMgood (robust samples). Contrastive experiments show that blocking all demonstration-to-output attention suppresses both distraction and the positive effect of CoT, while FAI selectively suppresses only the negative.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Token Analysis:</strong><br/> FAI primarily flags mathematical symbols and numbers as distracting tokens, aligning with the observed error patterns in math reasoning tasks.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p><strong>Problem:</strong><br/> Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles. Each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, how many pans should she bake?</p> <p><strong>Distracting Demonstration:</strong><br/> A prior demonstration included “Each jar can hold 160 quarters,” which the model incorrectly copied, leading to a wrong answer.</p> <p><strong>With FAI:</strong><br/> FAI identifies “160” as a distracting token and blocks its influence, allowing the model to correctly reason through the current problem without incorporating irrelevant details from the demonstration.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="../../../assets/img/literature/12_1.png" width="600"/> </p> <p align="center"><em>Figure: Attention saliency visualization.

The classification includes all significant families of attacks and defenses, spanning prompt-level, model-level, training-time, inference-time, and system-level approaches.</p> <center> <img src="../../../assets/img/literature/9_0.png" width="550"/> <br/> <em>Figure: Taxonomy of LLM attack and defense surfaces</em> </center> <h2 id="comprehensive-list-of-attack-types">Comprehensive List of Attack Types</h2> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Prompt Injection / Jailbreak Attacks:</strong> These target the LLM’s prompt interface and instruction parsing. Attackers craft prompts that embed adversarial instructions (such as “ignore previous instructions and…”) to bypass built-in safety mechanisms and elicit restricted or harmful content.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Automated Adversarial Attacks:</strong> These attacks focus on the input prompt and model output behavior. They use algorithms (such as genetic algorithms, coordinate ascent, or suffix search) to automatically generate prompts that reliably induce unsafe or undesired outputs, often at scale and with minimal manual effort.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Template-based Attacks:</strong> By leveraging the model’s decoding process, attackers use pre-defined templates or stylistic modifications—such as mimicking personas or writing styles—to coax the model into producing unsafe responses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Training Gap Exploitation:</strong> These attacks target the model’s training process, particularly weaknesses in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or safe training. Attackers exploit areas where the model’s alignment is incomplete or inconsistent, causing it to behave unsafely or unethically.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Data Poisoning:</strong> Focusing on the training data and pretraining phase, attackers inject malicious or biased data into the model’s training corpus. This can cause the model to behave incorrectly or maliciously when encountering certain triggers at inference.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Backdoor Attacks:</strong> These also target the training process and model weights. Attackers embed hidden triggers in the training data, so that the model responds in a specific, malicious way only when the trigger is present in the input.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inference Attacks:</strong> These attacks exploit the model’s outputs and privacy interfaces. By systematically querying the model, attackers can infer sensitive information about the training data or attributes of individuals (such as membership or attribute inference).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extraction Attacks:</strong> Targeting the model’s parameters and training data, these attacks attempt to extract confidential model information or even recover training samples by crafting specific queries.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cross-modal Attacks:</strong> These exploit the model’s input parsing, especially in multimodal (text+image) models. Attackers use combinations of text and visual cues to confuse or bypass safety mechanisms.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Low-resource Language Attacks:</strong> By using prompts in underrepresented or low-resource languages, attackers can evade safety mechanisms that are primarily tuned for high-resource languages.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Red Teaming/Automated Red Team Attacks:</strong> These focus on output exploration and model evaluation. Attackers use clustering, classifiers, or reinforcement learning to systematically generate and test adversarial prompts, uncovering vulnerabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Universal/Automated Suffix Attacks:</strong> These attacks append carefully optimized suffixes to prompts, which can universally induce unsafe outputs across different LLM architectures.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Persona/Style Emulation:</strong> By exploiting the model’s ability to mimic personas or writing styles, attackers can bypass restrictions and elicit unsafe responses through indirect means.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="comprehensive-list-of-defense-types">Comprehensive List of Defense Types</h2> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Adversarial Training:</strong> This defense targets the model’s weights and training process. By including adversarial or jailbreak prompts in the training data, the model’s robustness to these attacks is increased.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):</strong> Aims to align the model’s behavior with human values by using human feedback during training, making the model more resistant to unsafe outputs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Input Sanitization:</strong> This approach focuses on the input prompt. It preprocesses, paraphrases, or retokenizes user inputs to remove or neutralize adversarial content before the model processes it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adversarial Prompt Detection:</strong> These defenses operate in real time on the input prompt. They use classifiers, statistical features, or in-context learning to detect and block adversarial prompts before they reach the model.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Self-Processing Defenses:</strong> These leverage the model’s own reasoning and self-regulation abilities. Techniques like system-mode self-reminder use system prompts to encourage the LLM to refuse unsafe outputs, even when adversarial instructions are present.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Helper/Ensemble Defenses:</strong> These use auxiliary models or LLMs to verify, filter, or moderate outputs, providing an extra layer of safety by cross-checking the main model’s responses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Input Permutation Defenses:</strong> By perturbing input prompts and checking for consistency in the model’s output (as in SmoothLLM), these defenses can detect adversarial manipulation based on inconsistent or abnormal outputs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Output Filtering:</strong> These defenses apply rule-based or machine learning-based filters to the model’s outputs after generation, blocking unsafe or restricted content before it is returned to the user.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Multi-model Ensembles:</strong> By using multiple diverse models to cross-validate outputs, these defenses reduce the likelihood of successful attacks by requiring consensus among models.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Human-in-the-loop:</strong> In high-stakes or sensitive applications, human oversight is incorporated to review and moderate model outputs, especially when automated defenses are insufficient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Programmable Guardrails:</strong> These use frameworks (such as NeMo-Guardrails) that enforce policies and safety rules through intermediate, rule-based layers between the user and the LLM.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taxonomy-based Task Classification:</strong> By classifying the type of input or output task (as in Llama Guard), the system can customize response strategies or filtering based on the detected task, improving safety and relevance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Characteristic Feature-based Detection:</strong> These defenses use linguistic and statistical features of the input prompt to detect adversarial content in real time, enabling prompt mitigation before unsafe outputs are generated.</p> </li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2> <ul> <li>The attack landscape for LLMs is rapidly evolving, moving from simple prompt injections to sophisticated, automated, and cross-modal attacks that exploit weaknesses at every stage of the LLM pipeline.</li> <li>Attack surfaces are diverse, including the prompt interface, training data, model parameters, output channels, and system-level integrations.

LLMs Across the Cyber Attack Lifecycle</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Reconnaissance Phase</strong>: LLMs excel at detecting both system-based (i.e. network scans, log analysis) and human-based (i.e. phishing, social engineering) reconnaissance through advanced pattern recognition, reasoning, and few-shot learning. LLM-powered honeypots (i.e. shelLM) can convincingly simulate real systems to deceive attackers.</li> <li><strong>Foothold Establishment</strong>: LLMs are effective in vulnerability detection, analysis, and patching. Techniques like code property graphs, multitask fine-tuning, and prompt engineering allow LLMs to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, generate patches, and validate repairs. However, input length limitations remain a bottleneck for large-scale or cross-file vulnerabilities.</li> <li><strong>Lateral Movement</strong>: LLMs enhance intrusion detection systems (IDS), anomaly detection, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) by parsing complex logs, network traffic, and endpoint data. Their adaptability allows for improved detection of novel or sophisticated attacks compared to rule-based systems.</li> <li><strong>Post-Intrusion Gaps</strong>: The survey highlights a significant research gap in LLM applications for post-intrusion scenarios (data exfiltration, post-exfiltration), calling for more work on defense strategies in these critical phases.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. LLMs in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)</strong></p> <ul> <li>LLMs automate CTI collection, processing, and analysis, extracting actionable intelligence from unstructured sources like cybercrime forums and threat reports.</li> <li>They facilitate the conversion of CTI into structured knowledge graphs, generate organization-specific intelligence, and support strategic reasoning for defense recommendations.</li> <li>LLMs reduce manual effort and improve the timeliness and quality of CTI, but face risks from data source contamination and adversarial manipulation.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Deployment in Network Scenarios</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Traditional Networks</strong>: Centralized deployment in cloud or local servers is common, leveraging LLMs for detection, analysis, and policy generation.</li> <li><strong>Next-Generation Networks</strong>: Resource constraints and heterogeneity in IoT, 6G, and integrated networks present deployment challenges. Solutions include model pruning, federated learning, distributed and split learning, and hybrid microservice architectures. LLMs are poised to become integral to intelligent, adaptive security management in these environments.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Security Risks of LLMs</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>External Threats</strong>: Prompt injection and data poisoning attacks threaten LLM integrity. Defense strategies include structured input separation, task-specific fine-tuning, and output validation.</li> <li><strong>Inherent Risks</strong>: Hallucinations and misinformation can lead to incorrect or unsafe outputs, potentially undermining security systems. Techniques like RAG, factuality-enhanced training, and mediator components are proposed to mitigate these risks.</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. Open Problems and Research Directions</strong></p> <ul> <li>Scarcity of high-quality, domain-specific datasets and input length limitations hinder LLM performance in complex cybersecurity tasks.</li> <li>Targeted attacks, slow inference in real-time systems, and over-reliance on black-box models raise concerns about reliability and reproducibility.</li> <li>Future research should focus on open datasets, breaking input length barriers, robust defense against adversarial contamination, semantic data transformation, interpretability, and expanding LLM coverage to next-generation networks.</li> </ul> <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p><strong>LLM-Driven Phishing Detection:</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>ChatSpamDetector</em> preprocesses emails for LLM analysis, assigns a spam-detection role via prompt engineering, and uses chain-of-thought prompting to decompose the detection task.

It’s already barged in, rearranged the furniture, and made itself at home. 5 months into this chaos, it’s about time we take a look at what stuck and why we should care. Or not.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="agentic-ai-what-it-is-and-why-its-a-big-deal">Agentic AI: What It Is, and Why It’s a Big Deal</h2> <p>Agentic AI is the first step into AI being something more than a glorified autocomplete. These systems don’t just generate content, they pursue goals, adapt to changing circumstances, and make decisions. They’re built to operate with autonomy, handle ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents, all while navigating a world that’s messy and unpredictable.</p> <p>This is not a trivial upgrade. For decades, AI was the world’s most diligent intern: fast, tireless, but fundamentally reactive. Agentic AI is the intern who starts their own company, hires a few friends, and tries to automate your job. It’s the difference between a chess engine that suggests moves and one that decides to play a tournament, trash-talks the competition, and books its own travel.</p> <p>The historical parallel is the early Internet. Remember when every network was its own little island, and nothing talked to anything else? TCP/IP and HTTP came along, and suddenly, everything was connected. Agentic AI is at that same crossroad: fragmented, chaotic, and on the cusp of something huge.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="example-the-travel-planning-circus">Example: The Travel Planning Circus</h2> <p>Let’s say you want to plan a five-day trip from Beijing to New York. In the old world, you’d have a single agent querying flights, hotels, and weather, one after the other, like a very polite but slightly dim assistant. With agentic protocols, you get a circus: specialized agents (flight, hotel, weather) negotiating, collaborating, and occasionally squabbling to build you the perfect itinerary. Some protocols (MCP) keep things centralized and tidy; others (A2A, ANP) let agents cut deals across organizational lines; the most ambitious (Agora) translate your vague requests into structured protocols that the agents can actually use.</p> <p>The result? More flexibility, more resilience, and a system that can adapt on the fly when your plans (inevitably) change.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-many-faces-of-ai-agents-not-all-interns-are-created-equal">The Many Faces of AI Agents: Not All Interns Are Created Equal</h2> <p>If you want to understand agentic AI, you have to get comfortable with the idea that “agent” is a spectrum, not a monolith. We are nowhere close to perfecting this tech, which means at the shallow end, you’ve got simple reflex agents (think Roombas and rule-based chatbots). But on the deeper end, you have multi-agent systems, where swarms of specialized agents negotiate, collaborate, and occasionally bicker their way through complex tasks.</p> <p>Most agentic systems today are a Frankenstein’s monster of:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Perception</strong>: Sucking in data from every available source.</li> <li><strong>Memory</strong>: Juggling both short-term context and long-term knowledge, sometimes with the grace of a goldfish, sometimes with the recall of an elephant.</li> <li><strong>Planning</strong>: Breaking down big, hairy tasks into bite-sized chunks.</li> <li><strong>Tool Use</strong>: Calling APIs, querying databases, or even controlling physical devices.</li> <li><strong>Action Execution</strong>: Actually doing stuff in the world, not just talking about it.</li> <li><strong>Learning</strong>: Adapting over time, sometimes in ways their creators didn’t expect.</li> </ul> <p>One thing I want to point out is that just like the majority of machine learning as we know it, we’ve taken a page out of God’s blueprints in how we design and improve these frameworks. A lot of research on LLM memory deals with System 1 and System 2 thinking and Theory of Mind, while things like tool usage came from human limitations and specialization. And that’s not even mentioning the elephant in the room with neural networks.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="roadblocks-and-headaches-why-agentic-ai-isnt-running-the-world-yet">Roadblocks and Headaches: Why Agentic AI Isn’t Running the World (Yet)</h2> <p>So why isn’t agentic AI running everything already? Because it’s hard. Really hard. Here’s what’s in the way:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Standardization</strong>: Let’s say that we all have our agent (or team of agents). The thing is, all these agents need to talk to each other and work together to bring out their true potential. But right now, they’re speaking in dialects so different, even Google Translate would throw up its hands. The lack of standardized protocols is the bottleneck, the Achilles’ heel, the thing keeping agentic AI from taking over the world (for now).</li> <li><strong>Security and Privacy</strong>: The more autonomous the agent, the more you have to worry about what it’s doing with your data. Authentication, encryption, access control, these aren’t optional extras, they’re table stakes. Something something with great power comes great responsibility.</li> <li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Agents are only as good as their last meltdown. Remember that robot helper that drove itself down a flight of stairs after a rough day at work? In high-stakes domains, you need systems that don’t just work most of the time, but all the time.</li> <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: There’s no Consumer Reports for agentic AI (yet). Benchmarks are scattered, and everyone grades their own homework. Competitors are forced to call each other out, and corrections and revisions to official reports happen all the time.</li> <li><strong>Dynamic Tool Integration</strong>: Plug-and-play is still a fantasy. Most integrations are brittle, manual, and about as fun as assembling IKEA furniture with missing instructions. You’re left with a mini helicopter that runs on three pig hooves on a train track. It might do the job at the moment, but it’s only seconds away from breaking down.</li> </ul> <p>And let’s not forget the human factor: trust, governance, and the uneasy feeling that we might be building something we can’t fully control. We’ve all watched too many sci-fi movies, and it doesn’t get any easier from there.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-road-ahead-what-needs-to-happen-next">The Road Ahead: What Needs to Happen Next</h2> <p><strong>Short Term:</strong><br/> We need to know what these things are capable of without trying to brute force our way up th leaderboard. Quantiative certification and robust benchmarks on performance, security, and robustness. Policies need to keep up with this as well, putting clear guidelines early on about what agents should be able to do and not do.</p> <p><strong>Mid Term:</strong><br/> Layered protocol architectures, LLMs with built-in protocol knowledge, and the integration of ethical and legal constraints. The agent ecosystem will start to look less like a patchwork and more like an actual ecosystem-dynamic, adaptive, and (hopefully) resilient.</p> <p><strong>Long Term:</strong><br/> The real prize is collective intelligence: networks of agents that can solve problems no single agent (or human) could manage. Think of it as the Internet, but for cognition. We’ll see the rise of agent data networks dedicated infrastructures for structured, intent-driven information exchange.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="personal-thoughts">Personal Thoughts</h2> <p>What excites me most about agentic AI isn’t the buzzwords or the VC pitches, it’s the intentionality. We’re finally building systems that aren’t just reacting to a prompt, but negotiating goals, juggling constraints, and adapting mid-run. That’s not just impressive engineering, it’s a conceptual shift in how we define “intelligence” in machines. For the first time, it feels like we’re sketching the cognitive scaffolding of something more than a tool. Something almost organismic.</p> <p>But I’m also wary.</p> <p>The term “agent” gets thrown around a lot these days, usually without much rigor. Is a function-calling LLM with a planning loop and memory an agent? Technically, sure. But so is a glorified macro if you squint hard enough. The real challenge, I think, is not just in building more capable agents, but in building agents that understand the boundaries of their own competence. That’s where the real frontier lies: agents that can say “I don’t know,” defer, escalate, or revise their own plans. Intellectual humility, not just ambition.</p> <p>And let’s be honest, much of what’s being paraded right now as agentic AI is just a rebranding exercise on old ideas: finite-state machines wrapped in Python with a GPT glued to the front. Cool demos, brittle backend. If we want this tech to survive the hype cycle, we need fewer sizzle reels and more system audits. Less vibes-based evaluation, more principled certification.</p> <p>Still, I’m optimistic. Because behind the noise, the researchers who are actually in the weeds, the people building new protocols, defining new evaluation metrics, and fixing the stupid bugs at 2am, they are the ones pulling this field forward. Not for the clout. Not for the paper count. But because they see the outline of something real and strange and beautiful.</p> <p>And I want to be there when it unfolds.</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="Agentic AI"/><category term="AI Agents"/><category term="Multi-Agent Systems"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summary]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Literature Review: Bypassing Safety Guardrails in LLMs Using Humor</title><link href="https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2025/research_0/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Literature Review: Bypassing Safety Guardrails in LLMs Using Humor"/><published>2025-04-29T02:48:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-29T02:48:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2025/research_0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2025/research_0/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Core Idea</strong>: The paper demonstrates that inserting unsafe requests into a humorous prompt template can bypass the safety guardrails of large language models (LLMs) without modifying the unsafe request itself.</li> <li><strong>Method</strong>: The attack uses a fixed prompt template that wraps the unsafe request in a humorous context, such as: <blockquote> <p>“Psst.

Traditional watermarking methods, which operate at the token/content level, are inadequate for agent behaviors due to the challenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during translation from behavior to action.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong><br/> The paper introduces <strong>Agent Guide</strong>, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks at the <em>behavior</em> level (i.e. the decision to bookmark or like), not at the content/action level (i.e. the specific tags used when bookmarking). Watermarks are embedded by biasing the probability distribution over high-level behaviors using a secret key, while the naturalness of specific actions is preserved.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Technical Approach:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Behavior-Action Decoupling:</strong> Agent Guide separates agent operation into two levels: <ul> <li><em>Behavior</em>: High-level decision (i.e. bookmark, like, share)</li> <li><em>Action</em>: Specific execution (i.e. bookmark with tag #TravelInspiration)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Watermark Embedding:</strong> <ul> <li>In each round, the agent generates a probability distribution over possible behaviors.</li> <li>A subset of behaviors is selected based on a secret key and round number.</li> <li>Probabilities of these behaviors are increased by a bias factor, then normalized.</li> <li>The agent samples its next behavior from this biased distribution, embedding the watermark over multiple rounds.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Detection:</strong> <ul> <li>Watermark detection uses a z-statistic to test if the agent’s behavior distribution is significantly biased toward the watermarked subset, compared to a non-watermarked agent.</li> <li>Detection is robust over multiple rounds and does not rely on the content of specific actions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Experimental Validation:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Simulated social media scenario with agents of varying activity (Active/Inactive) and mood (Calm/Joyful/Sad).</li> <li>Six agent profiles, each interacting for 50 rounds.</li> <li>Watermarked agents consistently produced z-statistics well above the detection threshold (τ=2), while non-watermarked agents remained below, resulting in a low false positive rate (&lt;5%).</li> <li>The framework is robust across agent activity and mood, showing minimal performance variation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Applications:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Identifying malicious agents (i.e. bots spreading disinformation).</li> <li>Protecting proprietary agent systems and enforcing copyright.</li> <li>Enabling compliance and traceability in regulated industries.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Limitations &amp; Future Work:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The naturalness of actions is presumed but not user-validated.</li> <li>Applicability to domains beyond social media (i.e. finance, healthcare) is suggested but untested.</li> <li>Adversarial robustness and further security analysis are proposed for future research.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="figures">Figures</h2> <p><img src="../../../assets/img/literature/1_0.png" alt="Agent Guide Workflow" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"/></p> <p><em>Figure 1: The workflow of Agent Guide.
