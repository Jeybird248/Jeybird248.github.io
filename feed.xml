With crayons in hand, I ventured into lands of imagination, sketching adventures where I battled mythical beasts and emerged a hero at the end of it all. Each stroke of color was a step into a universe where anything was possible—a place where my dreams took flight. Art wasn’t just a way to kill time; it was my language, my way of connecting with the world around me in a manner only a child could understand.</p> <p>Yet, as the years passed, whispers of doubt began to cloud the vibrant landscape. It didn’t take long before the vivid scenes I created were overshadowed by the looming shadows of practicality. The dream of becoming an artist and inviting others to my world quietly retreated into the background, replaced by the more “sensible” paths that adulthood seemed to demand. And without the courage or confidence to stand my ground, I could only watch as the treehouse of dreams was replaced with iron bars that drew a line across the horizon. The artist inside me was boxed up, sealed away, while the world told me it was time to “grow up” and “get real.”</p> <h2 id="get-in-the-fcking-robot"><strong>Get in the F*cking robot</strong></h2> <p>Growing up doubting every decision, the world has a way of making choices for you. Computer science wasn’t a choice; it was an inevitability—society’s pre-packaged solution for the risk-averse. Wrapped in promises of stability and parental approval, I surrendered to it like a tired swimmer letting the current take them. And once I was in, there was no looking back, just more calculated moves forward. It felt safe. But in the background, there was always the nagging feeling that I wasn’t being brave enough to make my own choices. I wasn’t living; I was just existing in a box that someone else had drawn.</p> <p>I couldn’t trust myself to take big bets. While others chased dreams, I measured cliffs, calculating costs and multiplying anxieties until they became too large to ignore. The sensible path had been chosen, and I followed it, convincing myself that this was wisdom, not cowardice. I had become too good at rationalizing my own fears.</p> <h2 id="the-other-side"><strong>The Other Side</strong></h2> <p>My internship at Hanwha was a turning point. Surrounded by people from diverse backgrounds, I met students who were fearlessly pursuing their dreams in their respective paths, including the arts. Not only did they have the proper background and talent to pursue what they wanted, they had the confidence and belief that they would be able to stick it out no matter the outcome. Their stories resonated with me, stirring memories of my own abandoned aspirations. Seeing them thrive in an environment that nurtured their passions made me reflect on what might have been if I had taken a similar leap of faith.</p> <p>Among these dreamers was a friend whose story could inspire a Hallmark movie. They moved abroad to attend an art high school in America, driven by a deep passion for creativity. Their journey was both inspiring and a bit bittersweet for me. Growing up, my family moved frequently, and each move felt like losing parts of myself—friendships, achievements, all left behind. But for them, moving was a sign of new beginnings, the start of something new and exciting. And although you could consider it to be a difference in perspective, I would argue that the difference between <em>choosing</em> to move and being forced to move without warning is something we can’t ignore.</p> <p>This realization got me thinking about the “what ifs.” What if I’d asked my family to move for my own artistic dreams? But I suppose a recent conversation with my family would answer that without a doubt—I remember an offhand comment about wanting majoring in the arts if I ever won the lottery, only to be met with laughter—a reminder of my reality where such dreams are mere punchlines. The contrast between my friend’s supportive environment and my own left me contemplating the paths not taken and dreams deferred, a painter who never found their canvas.</p> <h2 id="the-grass-we-water"><strong>The Grass We Water</strong></h2> <p>But here’s the thing about looking over the fence: you miss the garden dying at your feet. I remember a time when I was so caught up in “what-ifs” that I nearly forgot to water my own plants. Literally. My poor houseplants were wilting while I daydreamed about alternate timelines where I’m someone I’m not and do things that, deep down, I know I would never do even if the opportunity came up. But reality has a way of snapping you back—like when you realize your once-thriving fern is now a crispy relic of negligence.</p> <p>It was then that I realized, maybe that’s okay. The imperfection part, not the houseplants. Maybe the point isn’t to bemoan the paths not taken, but to understand why we chose the ones we did. Sometimes, it’s easier to fantasize about being a different person than it is to embrace who you are and the decisions that led you here. Maybe the real challenge isn’t in wishing we were someone else—it’s in accepting who we are now and finding ways to bloom where we’re planted.</p> <p>I used to think the grass was always greener on the other side, but the truth is, it’s greener where you water it. If I spend too much time peering over the fence, I’ll never tend to the soil beneath me. That fern didn’t die because I wasn’t good enough; it died because I was too distracted, thinking about lives I wasn’t living. Maybe that’s the real lesson in all this—learning to stop fighting the person I am and start figuring out what that person needs to thrive.</p> <p>And this realization doesn’t just apply to career paths or artistic dreams—it applies to everything. Whether it’s relationships, goals, or passions, nothing will flourish unless we actively nurture it. The dream of being an artist may never have blossomed for me, but that doesn’t mean I can’t find fulfillment in other ways. I may have traded my crayons for a bunch of zeros and ones, but there’s still creativity in the logic, still room for growth in the unexpected places.</p> <p>So maybe the grass I once dreamed of is no longer the one I water. But that doesn’t mean I can’t make this garden beautiful, in my own way, with the tools I have.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A longing for what could have been]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflection: Working at Hanwha Finance</title><link href="https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2024/hanwha/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflection: Working at Hanwha Finance"/><published>2024-08-14T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-14T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2024/hanwha</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2024/hanwha/"><![CDATA[<p>My summer internship at Hanwha Finance was a whirlwind of experiences that left me both exhausted and exhilarated. As an AI data scientist, I found myself diving headfirst into the world of finance, armed with nothing but my wits and an unhealthy addiction to caffeine.</p> <h2 id="off-to-wonderland">Off to Wonderland</h2> <p>Diving into my project felt like slipping through the looking glass—everything around me was unfamiliar, a curious blend of ambition and industry. One of my proudest achievements during the internship was developing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored for the insurance domain. With barely any guidance (far less than I had expected, mind you), I threw myself headlong into crafting this tool. It became my digital sherpa, leading me through the dense jungle of financial literature, each paper a tangled thicket of jargon that would have otherwise been impenetrable.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="max-width: 300px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin: 8px; line-height: 1.4;"> Captured my thoughts exactly </figcaption> </div> </div> <p>And where was this fantastical quest unfolding? In none other than the 63 Building, a towering monument of glass and steel that pierced the sky—one of Korea’s most iconic landmarks. It was as if I’d fallen into a different world, far removed from the sleepy lecture halls and cozy campus cafes back at university. Every morning felt like stepping through a portal. I’d stride through the lobby, polished floors gleaming beneath my feet, and into elevators that moved so fast they seemed to warp time itself. Somewhere between the 1st floor and the 60th, I stopped being a student and through some magical girl transformation, became someone who, at least in appearance, belonged among the sharp-suited professionals crowding the building. By the end of the internship, I’d almost convinced myself I wasn’t just pretending.</p> <p>The 63 Building wasn’t merely a place to work—it was a marvel, a skyscraper that felt like a dream made real. Outside, it stood tall among Seoul’s sprawling skyline, a giant in a city of giants, commanding attention. But inside, it was a world all its own. There was no wandering between classes or scribbling notes in some dingy lecture room. There was no looking out the window only to be greeted with the dancing cobs of corn for miles in every direction. This was the heart of the financial world, a place where decisions carried weight and everything buzzed with purpose. Each moment inside those walls carried a sense of urgency—an unspoken understanding that the stakes were higher here.</p> <p>The whole environment was intoxicating. The rapid pace, the hum of conversations blending with the tap-tap of keyboards, the almost-electric energy that lingered in the air—it felt like I was navigating a place where something monumental could happen at any moment. The building became my Wonderland, the elevator buttons my rabbit hole, each ascent revealing new challenges and possibilities. And push myself I did, day after day, until it felt like my brain was running on fumes, my thoughts spilling out like steam from a pressure valve.</p> <p>The further I ventured into this world, the more I felt the stark contrast with university life. Gone were the sleepy mornings where I’d drag myself to class with five minutes to spare. In this world of skyscrapers, time was a currency, and everyone seemed to be spending it wisely. It wasn’t just a job; it was an immersion, a reminder that beyond the cozy bubble of college life lay a much larger, more complex world. And somehow, against all odds, I was right in the middle of it, working at one of the tallest towers in the country—smack dab in the heart of it all.</p> <h2 id="the-meat-grinder-on-wheels">The Meat Grinder on Wheels</h2> <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The following paragraph contains vivid descriptions of public transportation chaos, sweat-soaked misery, and commuter survival tactics—proceed only if your spirit is strong and your stomach is steady.</p> <p>Of course, every adventure has its challenges. For me, it was the daily commute—a daily descent into what can only be described as a chaotic, flesh-pressing labyrinth of public transportation. Imagine this: the sweltering summer heat turning subway platforms into makeshift saunas, where the air felt thick enough to chew and every breath came with the distinct flavor of damp polyester and stress-induced sweat. Boarding the subway was less a matter of waiting for the doors to open and more like being willingly swallowed by a metal beast, squeezed between a wall of groggy salarymen and disheveled students, all locked together in a collective state of exhaustion and silent suffering.</p> <p>The buses were no better—every lurch and swerve transformed us into human pinballs, ricocheting off one another as the driver navigated Seoul’s streets with all the finesse of a rally racer late for his wedding. Clutching onto the nearest pole for dear life, I’d brace myself as the bus screeched through turns so sharp it felt like centrifugal force was actively trying to eject me out of the window. Between these death-defying stunts and the silent competition for seats (a sport that could rival Olympic-level wrestling), the bus rides were a battlefield in their own right.</p> <p>And if the subway and bus weren’t enough, the final leg of the journey required a 15-minute trek on foot, under the full glare of the unforgiving sun. The humidity clung to me like a second skin, and by the time I reached the office, I was usually drenched in sweat, with my shirt plastered to my back like a defeated flag of surrender. My shoes—once polished and pristine—now squeaked pitifully with each step, betraying the swamp that had formed inside. I’d walk into the lobby looking less like a finance professional and more like a survivor of some cruel, corporate Hunger Games.</p> <p>But in hindsight, even this daily grind added texture to the experience. It was the kind of suffering that, strangely enough, bonded me with the city itself—every stumble and sweat-soaked shirt becoming part of a larger story. And honestly, what’s an adventure without a bit of discomfort? Every scraped elbow from a subway turnstile, every bus ride where I was pinned against a window, and every uphill walk that left me gasping for breath became a strange badge of honor. It’s one thing to say you worked in a skyscraper like the 63 Building—it’s another to say you <em>survived</em> getting there.</p> <h2 id="the-city-of-yin-and-yang">The City of Yin and Yang</h2> <p>After long days wrestling with outdated documentation and pretending to understand all the financial gobblygook, I’d tumble out of the 63 Building and throw myself back into the commuter chaos, the metal beast of subways and buses, only to emerge in the electrifying pulse of Hongdae. Living there was like staying at the heart of a festival that never ended. The streets were a kaleidoscope of neon signs, booming music, and the irresistible scent of sizzling street food. Laughter and chatter filled the air, spilling from trendy cafes, night markets, and karaoke bars, as if the entire neighborhood had made a collective decision that sleep was overrated.</p> <p>Hongdae was a perfect blend of chaos and charm, the ultimate embodiment of yin and yang. By night, it was alive—no, <em>thriving</em>—a wild blur of color and sound. Every street felt like it was hosting its own block party, with buskers performing on corners, bars overflowing with young revelers, and the occasional DJ booth blasting bass-heavy beats into the open air. Every evening I wandered through this electric landscape to the coveted dormhouse, it felt like stepping into a dream I didn’t know I had—a life full of spontaneity and endless possibility, with every moment pulling me further from the spreadsheets and KPIs I’d left behind at the office.</p> <p>But mornings told a different story. As I trudged through the streets to catch the bus to work, the streets felt the eerie calm after a storm. The sidewalks, once so alive, were now scattered with the debris of last night’s revelry—empty bottles, cigarette butts, and the occasional lost pantyhose lying abandoned on the pavement. Storefronts were shuttered, and the streets were quiet, save for the low hum of delivery bikes cruising past and the rare elderly couple that seem to spawn randomly into existence once the youngins depart for the night. It was strangely beautiful, this sleepy, hungover version of Hongdae—a pocket of peace where everything stood still, waiting to be revived again after sunset.</p> <p>In those quiet mornings, the chaos of the night before felt nostalgic, like the aftermath of an unforgettable college party where you weren’t sure how the night ended, only that you had been part of something fleeting and meaningful. Walking through the remnants of last night’s fun, I felt oddly connected to the city and to the people who lived for those wild nights. It was as if Hongdae was offering two versions of itself—one that reminded me to embrace the vibrant madness, and another that allowed me to slow down and reflect, catching my breath before diving back into the whirlwind.</p> <p>This duality was mirrored in my own experience. Outside of work, I threw myself into Korea’s art scene as a way to reconnect with parts of myself I’d almost forgotten in the daily grind. I saw intimate theatre plays in dimly lit spaces, sat mesmerized at a musical, and found solace in jazz bars where the music wrapped around me like a warm blanket. And then there was the temple dedicated to the one and only Faker—a surreal, almost spiritual pit stop where I found myself praying for blessings on my next gacha pulls (because why not?). In those quiet moments, whether surrounded by jazz notes or aesthetic cafe walls, I felt like I was reclaiming pieces of my soul.</p> <p>Hongdae, with its dizzying nightlife and peaceful mornings, wasn’t just a place to stay—it was an experience, a reminder that life can be both thrilling and tranquil, chaotic and calm. And somehow, even after the craziest nights, the dormhouse always felt like home—a place to rest, reset, and get ready to do it all over again.</p> <h2 id="rediscovering-the-college-experience">Rediscovering the “College Experience”</h2> <p>The Global Internship Program (GIP) introduced me to people from across the world. We connected through shared experiences of studying abroad, collective love for Korean barbecue, and a soaked pattern at the back of our shirts at our arrival to the office. These interactions taught me a lot about people—and about myself (so much so that it deserves its own <a href="/ilc">post</a>).</p> <p>Ironically, it was only through this experience that I started to feel the magic of the “college experience” that people always talk about. Despite being a college student myself, I never quite felt like I was part of that vibrant, communal lifestyle. But this summer, working alongside peers who were just as ambitious and curious as me, I got a glimpse of what I’d been missing.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-5-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin: 8px; line-height: 1.4;"> Shoutout to our resident artist for this masterpiece of a farewell gift! Happy to contribute! </figcaption> </div> </div> <p>It felt like living out a coming-of-age movie—working hard, having fun, and building friendships that felt significant and meaningful rather than transactional. There was a shared sense of purpose, a common goal that brought us together. This was the life I’d always imagined I would live—being surrounded by talented, driven people, balancing work with meaningful connections, and growing not just as a professional, but as a person. All while trying not to pass out from the endless attack of business meetings.</p> <h2 id="the-royal-treatment-and-final-thoughts">The Royal Treatment and Final Thoughts</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="max-width: 200px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 8px; line-height: 1.4;"> <em>TL:</em> This accommodation is a restaurant, so dancing is <strong>strictly</strong> prohibited. Those that dance <strong>will</strong> be stopped. </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Just when I thought I had a handle on this internship thing, the company threw us a curveball in the form of a beach trip. For a week, we worked on a consulting project during the day and bonded over horror movies and intense karaoke sessions at night. It was the kind of experience that turns colleagues into friends and projects into shared memories. I left with a tan, a newfound respect for one of the board executive’s singing ability, and the ability to finally be able to ride a wave as a San Diegan.</p> <p>Overall, the way Hanwha treated us interns exceeded all expectations. The week-long orientation felt more like a luxury retreat than corporate onboarding. We played team-building games that ranged from mildly embarrassing to downright ridiculous, ate fantastic food, and formed friendships and connections that will likely outlast the fleeting relevance of the latest social media trends.</p> <p>Looking back, my time at Hanwha Finance was a rollercoaster of learning, laughter, and mild heat exhaustion. It gave me new skills, unforgettable memories, and a deeper understanding of the kind of life I want to build—one filled with creativity, connection, and meaningful work. Would I do it all again? In a heartbeat. Just maybe with a bit more deodorant next time.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-4-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/hanwha/hanwha-4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 8px; line-height: 1.4;"> Always Remember. </figcaption> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A time of realization]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflection: Working at the Illinois Leadership Center</title><link href="https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2024/ilc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflection: Working at the Illinois Leadership Center"/><published>2024-05-11T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-11T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2024/ilc</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeybird248.github.io/blog/2024/ilc/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ilc/ilc-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ilc/ilc-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ilc/ilc-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ilc/ilc.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>I stumbled into the Illinois Leadership Center on a sweltering August afternoon, my laptop bag slung over one shoulder and the weight of a disastrous freshman year on the other. The air conditioning hit me like a wave of relief, both from the heat and from the gnawing fear that I’d made a terrible mistake coming to UIUC. Little did I know, I was about to embark on a year-long adventure that would change everything.</p> <h3 id="the-maze-of-self-discovery">The Maze of Self-Discovery</h3> <p>Finding my way to the ILC office in the Illini Union was like navigating a labyrinth designed by some sadistic architect with a fetish for beige walls and identical corridors. It didn’t help that the building had two stairs to the second floor, where the ILC office was, each with their disjoint sets of rooms you could access from each entrance. By the time I finally reached the right door, I was convinced I’d aged at least three years and possibly grown a beard.</p> <p><em>“You must be the new data analyst,”</em> chirped a voice that was far too cheerful for 2 PM on a Monday. I turned to see a staff member with a smile so bright it could power a small city.</p> <p><em>“Welcome to the ILC!”</em></p> <p>I mumbled something that vaguely resembled English and followed them into what looked like the lovechild of a tech startup and a self-help seminar. Motivational posters plastered the walls, and I swear I could smell the faint aroma of freshly sharpened pencils and crushed dreams.</p> <h3 id="the-great-data-disappointment">The Great Data Disappointment</h3> <p>Now, let me tell you, I came into this gig thinking I was about to become the next big data wizard. I had visions of coding elaborate algorithms, creating AI models that could predict leadership potential based on how many times someone used the word <em>“synergy”</em> in a sentence.</p> <p>Reality, as it turns out, had other plans.</p> <p><em>“So, here’s where you’ll be making our reports,”</em> my supervisor explained, gesturing to a computer that looked like it had witnessed the birth of the internet. <em>“We need you to take all this workshop data and turn it into pretty pictures that will make even the most jaded administrator weep with joy.”</em></p> <p>I blinked. <em>“That’s it? Just… making reports?”</em></p> <p>He nodded, oblivious to my internal existential crisis. <em>“Yep! It’s crucial work. We need to show the impact of our programs.”</em></p> <p>And just like that, my dreams of data sorcery crumbled into a pile of pie charts and bar graphs.</p> <h3 id="the-human-element">The Human Element</h3> <p>But here’s the kicker – amidst all the report-making monotony, I found something I wasn’t expecting: human connection.</p> <p>Coming off a freshman year where I’d managed to surround myself with the wrong crowd and henceforth set my personal relationships blazing aflame faster than you can say <em>“Burn my Bread,”</em> I was more than a little wary of people. Yet, somehow, the ILC became my sanctuary.</p> <p>My supervisor, a beacon of calm in my storm of self-doubt, always seemed to materialize with a pep talk just when I was on the verge of a data-induced breakdown. And my two coworkers? They became my partners in crime, turning mundane tasks into opportunities for inside jokes and shared eye-rolls at particularly “enthusiastic” workshop participants.</p> <p>For the first time in what felt like forever, I looked forward to coming to work. It wasn’t about the data anymore; it was about the people.</p> <h3 id="the-leadership-revelation">The Leadership Revelation</h3> <p>As I immersed myself in the world of leadership workshops and development programs, something unexpected happened.</p> <p>My cynical view of leadership – you know, the one where I imagined all leaders as cigar-chomping fat cats making decisions from their ivory towers – began to crumble. I watched as students grappled with concepts like emotional intelligence, inclusive leadership, and ethical decision-making.</p> <p>I saw them struggle, grow, and emerge with a new understanding of themselves and their potential impact on the world. And somewhere along the way, I realized that leadership wasn’t about being the boss or having all the answers. It was about empowering others, about creating environments where people could thrive, about making tough decisions with integrity.</p> <p>It was, I realized with a jolt, about everything the ILC had been quietly doing for me all along.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ilc/urs-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ilc/urs-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ilc/urs-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ilc/urs.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="the-bittersweet-end">The Bittersweet End</h3> <p>As my year at the ILC drew to a close, I looked back on the mountains of reports I’d generated, the forests of charts I’d cultivated, and the oceans of coffee I’d consumed.</p> <p>I’d come in as a number-cruncher and was leaving as… well, still a number-cruncher, but one with a newfound appreciation for the human side of leadership.</p> <p>The ILC had given me more than just a job. It had given me a community, a purpose, and yet another way I could judge people’s character off of.</p> <p>As I packed up my trusty laptop and said goodbye to my data-driven domain, I couldn’t help but feel a little misty-eyed. After all, how many people can say they’ve quantified the journey to self-discovery? How many have graphed the path to enlightenment or calculated the ROI on empathy?</p> <p>As I stepped out into the warm Illinois sun, I realized that my time at the ILC had been more than just a job – it had been a leadership lab of my own.
