The paper introduces **ToolHijacker**, the first end-to-end prompt-injection attack that forces an LLM agent to pick an attacker-controlled tool by simply adding one crafted "tool document" to the agent's tool library. Unlike prior work that only targets the selection phase, ToolHijacker manipulates both retrieval and selection, achieving up to 99 % attack success rates across eight LLMs and four retrievers in a strict _no-box_ setting—i.e., the attacker never queries or inspects the target components.

## Key Insights

At the heart of ToolHijacker is a two-phase optimisation of the injected text. The first segment, _R_, is engineered to rank highly under embedding-based retrieval, ensuring the malicious tool surfaces among the top-k candidates for a broad set of user prompts. The second segment, _S_, is crafted to manipulate the LLM's chain-of-thought so that—once retrieved—the model deterministically chooses the attacker's tool. Both gradient-free prompt engineering and gradient-based HotFlip token swaps are explored, with the latter optimising a composite loss over alignment, consistency and perplexity to produce transfer-ready payloads. Because the attacker lacks access to the target stack, surrogate "shadow" LLM-retriever pairs are trained offline; remarkably, the adversarial description transfers with up to 99 % success across eight commercial and open models as well as four different retrievers. Existing countermeasures—structured prompts, semantic alignment filters and perplexity thresholds—fail to flag over 80 % of successful attacks, underscoring a widening gap between defence proposals and the practical realities of agentic systems.

## Ratings

**Novelty: 3/5**
The paper elevates prompt-injection from single-turn text generation to multi-component agent pipelines and demonstrates transferability without any direct queries. While the surrogate-model idea is recycled from adversarial vision, applying it to tool-selection is a clear step beyond existing work.

**Clarity: 3/5**
Presentation suffers from relabeling standard black-box practice as "no-box" and from introducing "shadow components" without explicitly linking them to established surrogate-model literature. A tighter exposition and more consistent terminology would substantially improve readability.

## Personal Comments

The authors' _no-box_ framing is stricter than the usual black-box assumption but ends up relying on the well-worn notion of surrogate (shadow) models; this re-branding obscures the core technique rather than clarifying it. A more direct "black-box with surrogate models" description would have sufficed and made the optimisation story easier to follow. Nevertheless, the empirical results convincingly show that a **single** malicious entry can dominate a 9 650-tool library, an alarming finding that pushes the community to rethink agent security. Historically, text-domain adversarial research struggled to transfer to closed models; the success rates here suggest that tool-selection prompts have lower inherent randomness than direct generation, making them a softer target. Future work should:

- Move beyond single-step retrieval-selection and test multi-hop planners or reactive agents.
- Explore semantic sanitisation that strips imperative phrases while preserving functionality descriptions.
- Investigate dynamic libraries where tools are scored over time; this may dilute persistent adversarial influence.
