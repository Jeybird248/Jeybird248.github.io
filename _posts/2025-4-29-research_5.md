## Summary

- **Problem**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle with real-world web automation tasks due to the complexity and length of raw web page observations (i.e. HTML, accessibility trees), which hinders effective decision making.
- **Proposed Solution**: The authors introduce **LCoW** (Learning to Contextualize Web pages), a framework that decouples web page understanding from decision making. LCoW trains a dedicated contextualization module to transform complex web observations into concise, task-relevant, and comprehensible representations for LLM agents.
- **Training Algorithm**: LCoW employs an iterative process:
  - Collect successful agent trajectories on web tasks.
  - For each observation, sample multiple candidate contextualizations.
  - Score each candidate by how well various LLM agents can predict the next correct action from it.
  - Fine-tune the contextualization module to maximize the likelihood of producing the best-scoring contextualizations.
- **Benchmarks & Results**:
  - Evaluated on WebShop, WorkArena, and WebArena benchmarks.
  - LCoW yields substantial success rate improvements (i.e. +15.6% for closed-source LLMs, +23.7% for open-source LLMs on WorkArena).
  - Achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebShop, outperforming human experts.
  - Generalizes to unseen LLMs and tasks, and improves performance even for smaller models.
- **Qualitative Analysis**: The contextualization module not only extracts relevant UI elements but also provides verbal explanations, reducing redundant or inadmissible actions and improving efficiency.
- **Limitations**: Generalization is limited when encountering entirely new UI elements or task categories not seen during training. The approach incurs additional latency due to the contextualization step.

## Key Insights

- **Decoupling Perception and Decision**: Separating the web page understanding (contextualization) from the action selection (decision making) allows LLM agents to focus on high-level reasoning, leveraging their strengths.
- **Data-Efficient Training**: LCoW can leverage a relatively small number of successful demonstrations to train the contextualization module, which then generalizes to new agents and tasks.
- **Robustness and Generalization**: The contextualization module, trained to maximize action predictability across multiple LLMs, avoids overfitting and enhances adaptability to different agent architectures and unseen tasks.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Agents using LCoW complete tasks with fewer redundant actions and higher success rates, especially on complex or cluttered web pages.
- **Limitations**: Generalization to tasks with entirely new UI elements or categories not seen during training remains challenging, and the added inference step introduces some latency.

## Example

**Task**: "Purchase me an iPad pro with silver color and 128GB storage."

- **Raw Observation**: Lengthy, unstructured accessibility tree with many irrelevant elements.
- **Contextualized Observation** (LCoW output):
  - Highlights only the relevant UI elements: color options ("Silver" selected), storage options ("128GB" selected), quantity, and the "Order Now" button.
  - Provides reasoning: "We have navigated to the Hardware store and clicked on the iPad pro link. The actions needed to accomplish the user instruction are to choose color option and disk option."
  - Guides the agent to efficiently select the required options and complete the order.
