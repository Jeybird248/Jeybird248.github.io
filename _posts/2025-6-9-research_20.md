Thinkless introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to adaptively choose between short-form and long-form reasoning based on task complexity and model capability. The work addresses a fundamental inefficiency in reasoning models: applying elaborate chain-of-thought reasoning uniformly to all queries, even when straightforward solutions exist.

## Key Insights

The paper's central technical contribution is Decoupled Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeGRPO), which decomposes hybrid reasoning training into two balanced components: mode selection via control tokens and response accuracy improvement. This addresses a critical failure mode in vanilla GRPO where the single control token receives weak gradient signals compared to hundreds of response tokens, leading to mode collapse during training.

The training methodology involves two stages: supervised distillation using expert models (reasoning and instruction-following) to create paired long-short responses, followed by reinforcement learning with a minimally designed reward function that preferences short correct answers over long ones. The framework employs two control tokens, `<short>` for concise responses and `<think>` for detailed reasoning, generated as the first token to signal inference style.

Empirically, the method demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains, reducing long-chain thinking usage by 50-90% across benchmarks like Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K while maintaining comparable performance. The training dynamics reveal a characteristic U-shaped learning curve where the model initially prefers long reasoning for higher accuracy, then progressively learns to assign simpler queries to short-form responses as training improves both mode selection and response quality.

## Example

Consider a simple arithmetic problem like "The arithmetic mean of 7, 2, x and 10 is 9. What is the value of x?" versus a complex mathematical proof involving projections and real roots. Thinkless learns to assign P(<think>|x) = 0.003534 to the former (requiring only basic computation) while assigning P(<think>|x) = 1.000000 to the latter (demanding deep logical reasoning). This demonstrates the model's ability to calibrate reasoning depth based on problem complexity without manual heuristics.

## Ratings

**Novelty: 3/5** - While hybrid reasoning concepts exist, the DeGRPO algorithm presents a meaningful technical contribution addressing real training instabilities. The decoupled optimization approach is novel and addresses a specific failure mode in applying GRPO to hybrid reasoning tasks.

**Clarity: 4/5** - Exceptionally well-written with clear methodology, comprehensive experimental analysis, and insightful visualization of training dynamics. The paper provides thorough ablation studies and addresses potential failure modes systematically.

## Personal Comments

This work tackles a genuinely important problem, but it highlights a fundamental tension I've been grappling with: the boundary between "what requires thinking vs not" remains deeply ambiguous, even outside the LLM context. While theory of mind research provides statistical backing for human reasoning patterns, we lack theoretical grounding for how this should manifest in LLMs, particularly regarding mode detection mechanisms.

The paper feels inherently empirical because of this ambiguity. The reward function design (preferencing short correct answers with a simple Î³ parameter) seems almost naive given the complexity of the underlying question: when should an intelligent system engage in deliberate reasoning? The success of such a minimalist approach actually raises more questions about whether we're capturing the right abstractions.

What excites me most is the potential for combining this framework with other fine-tuning paradigms. How would Thinkless interact with instruction tuning, constitutional AI, or even more recent approaches like Constitutional AI? The decoupled optimization principle could potentially be applied to other multi-objective training scenarios beyond reasoning mode selection.

The U-shaped learning curve observation is particularly fascinating, it suggests the model develops a sophisticated understanding of its own capabilities and task difficulty. However, I worry about generalization: will these learned patterns transfer to domains beyond mathematics? The evaluation focuses heavily on mathematical reasoning tasks, leaving questions about broader applicability.

The mode collapse analysis in vanilla GRPO reveals important insights about multi-objective optimization in RL that extend beyond this specific application. This kind of careful analysis of training dynamics is what separates good empirical work from mere experimentation. The field needs more of this systematic approach to understanding why and how our training procedures work.
